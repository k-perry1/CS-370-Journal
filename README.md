In this project I was provided with different sections of code such as the agents environment, reward system, and partial code for the Q-learning algorithm. I created the loop within the algorithm for the agent to determine its action, act, receive a reward, store its memory, then train itself to find a better path. 
Computer scientists use conceptual ideas and research, such as artificial intelligence, to create technology and solve everyday problems. It is best to approach a problem with an open and calm mind as computer scientists. This allows you to fully deconstruct the task you were given in an objective manner to find an effective solution. 


As a computer scientist you have ethical responsibilities to the end user, your organization, and society. Technology can have a major impact on the world, and it is the responsibility of computer scientists to behave ethically and stand up against poor ethics to protect society. As a computer scientist you have the potential to reduce/avoid harm on people, impact discrimination, and contribute to the overall well-being of society.
